# Echoes of the body
Master Thesis in Music Engineering, Politecnico di Milano with collaboration IPEM - Ghent University

The project explores how real-time physiological signals, primarily breathing and heart rate, collected during the Shambhavi Mahamudra practice, can be used to:
- classify the practitioner's psychophysiological state,
- generate musical soundscapes driven by biofeedback.

The goal is to study whether these compositions can induce similar states in a secondary listener, bridging physiological awareness and musical interaction.
