# Echoes of the body
Master Thesis

The project explores how real-time physiological signals — primarily breathing and heart rate — collected during the Shambhavi Mahamudra practice, can be used to:
- classify the practitioner's psychophysiological state,
- and generate adaptive musical soundscapes driven by biofeedback.

The goal is to study whether these adaptive compositions can induce similar states in a secondary listener, bridging physiological awareness and musical interaction.
