## Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees, which improves generalization by aggregating the predictions of multiple trees trained on random subsets of the data and features.

## XGBoost Classifier
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and performance in structured data problems.
It builds trees sequentially, correcting errors of previous trees, and uses regularization to avoid overfitting.
